/*
In NativeScript, the app.css file is where you place CSS rules that
you would like to apply to your entire application. Check out
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling for a full list of the CSS
selectors and properties you can use to style UI components.

/*
For example, the following CSS rule changes the font size of all UI
components that have the btn class name.
*/
.btn {
    font-size: 18;
}
.quizImage{
    border-radius: 50%;
    background-size: cover;
}

.imageBackgroundContainer{
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    background-size: cover;
}

.navigationButton{
    background-color: white;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 1;
    border-radius: 50%;
}

/*
In many cases you may want to use the NativeScript core theme instead
of writing your own CSS rules. For a full list of class names in the theme
refer to http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.

@import 'nativescript-theme-core/css/core.light.css';
